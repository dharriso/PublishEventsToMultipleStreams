# PublishEventsToMultipleStreams
Publish JSON Events into 1 or more Streams. This is a test harness to publish events for testing

Stream names are assumed to be named Events0, Events1 etc. It is assumed they have been previously created.
Subject names for the Streams are assumed to be "Events0.>", "Events1.>"

Gradle command to build  gradlew clean build fatJar.
This will create an uber jar that can be deployed.

Usage
java -jar PublishEventsToNats-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar -mc=1000 -streams=3 -timeId=66 -useId=22 -group=1 -s=altdb01-eh-nats:4222 -tst=publishAllStreams  

"-mc" command line argument is the Message count or nyumber of message you want added to each stream.
"-stream" command line argument is number of streams you require the message to be added to, default is 1 i.e. Events0. Assumed the following naming convention "Events0", "Events1" etc.
"-timeId" command line argument defines value of timeId attribute to use in the JSON event to be sent to NATS.
"-useId" command line argument defines value of timeId attribute to use in the JSON event to be sent to NATS.
"-group" command line argument defines value of timeId attribute to use in the JSON event to be sent to NATS.
"-s" command line argument defines the nats endpoint either the k8s service or hostname.
"-tst" is the actual test or command to be executed. Currently only "publishAllStreams" is only supported.

Note: The autogenerated JSON event "root customer ID hash" attribute is a randomly generated number (0-255) added to the JSON event.
      The Subject line for each message added to NATS will be randomly generated as follows, literal string matching the stream name e.g. "Events0.", with a random integer (0-60000) appended to this literal e.g. "Events0.25409" or "Events1.967", "Events3.9986"
